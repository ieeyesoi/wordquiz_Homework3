## Program Development Environment
We developed _Wordquiz_ through GCC + Open Source Editor.

# What we learned
While developing the word quiz program, I learned that cooperation with team members is the most important. In the development process, I learned that there were points to be supplemented when correcting errors and adding necessary characteristics, and it took more effort and time to carry out the program than I thought. In all of these, smooth collaboration and division of labor with team members are very important.
